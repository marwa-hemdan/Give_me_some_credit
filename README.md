# Give_me_some_credit
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset, a financial dataset used to assess credit risk. The goal is to build insights and tools that help predict whether an individual will experience financial distress within the next two years.

Banks use credit scoring models like this one to make informed decisions about lending. By analyzing financial behaviors and demographic indicators, we can better understand patterns of default risk.
